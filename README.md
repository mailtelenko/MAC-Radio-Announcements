# MAC-Radio-Announcements
A web application built using Firebase which manages school announcements. 

## About
The web app will pull any announcements from a Firebase database which have been approved by a moderator and are set to run between any two dates. While approved announcements are public, the submission system can only be accessed by members of the tdsb.on.ca domain. 

### Moderation
Moderators can be anyone within the tdsb.on.ca domain. Moderators can be added or removed through the admin console. Admins must be added or removed manually from the system.

## Usage
Navigate to ```https://mailtelenko.github.io/MAC-Radio-Announcements/``` to view and use the application.

## Installation
To use the announcement system on you website insert the following HTML into your page:\
```<iframe src="https://mailtelenko.github.io/MAC-Radio-Announcements/" style="width:100%; height:100%;">```\
The size of the interface can be changed by modifying the ```width``` and ```height``` values.
